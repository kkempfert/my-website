  * Fit generative long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks on rainfall time series from weather stations across the United States; generated thousands of synthetic time series from these fits; and analyzed the results to detect and characterize climate change
  * Performed simulation studies to draw connections between state-space models and recurrent neural networks.

  * Classified the composer of Haydn and Mozart string quartets based on musical scores and set benchmark results that exceed 85% leave-one-out classification accuracy
  * Developed novel features based on the sonata form that can be automatically computed and applied to other tasks in music information retrieval (MIR)
  * Provided model-based interpretations about Haydn and Mozart that could be relevant to musicologists

  * Participated in the 10-week Statistical Data Mining & Machine Learning NSF-REU at the University of North Carolina Wilmington then continued research project for over two years
  * Developed a novel machine learning pipeline for the large face database Morph-II; classified over 55,000 photographs in Morph-II as picturing either a male or a female; and reached over 95% cross-validated accuracy (competitive with benchmark)
  * Compared the performance of kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), supervised KPCA, and kernel linear discrimnant analysis via simulation studies and results on Morph-II

  * Began the project by participating in the 10-week Parallel Computing Summer School and returned the next summer in the Information Systems & Modeling (A-1) research group
  * Forecasted dengue fever with high accuracy and confidence for all 27 states of Brazil using time series variables from heterogeneous data streams (doctors' offices, weather stations, satellites, and Google Health Trends)
  * Systematically compared predictive performance among variants of SARIMA, vector autoregression, seasonal trend decomposition, and ensembles combining these methods; reached Pearson correlation coefficients (between observed and fitted values) of up to 96.44% for 2-week-ahead forecasting
