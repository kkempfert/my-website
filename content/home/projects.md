  * Participated in the 10-week Statistical Data Mining & Machine Learning NSF-REU at the University of North Carolina Wilmington then continued research project for over two years
  * Developed a novel machine learning pipeline for the large face database Morph-II; classified over 55,000 photographs in Morph-II as picturing either a male or a female; and reached over 95% cross-validated accuracy (competitive with benchmark)
  * Compared the performance of kernel principal component analysis (KPCA), supervised KPCA, and kernel linear discrimnant analysis via simulation studies and results on Morph-II

  * Forecasted dengue fever with high accuracy and confidence for all 27 states of Brazil using time series variables from heterogeneous data streams (doctors' offices, weather stations, satellites, and Google Health Trends)
  * Systematically compared predictive performance among variants of SARIMA, vector autoregression, seasonal trend decomposition, and ensembles combining these methods; reached Pearson correlation coefficients (between observed and fitted values) of up to 96.44% for 2-week-ahead forecasting
