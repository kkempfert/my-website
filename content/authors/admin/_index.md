I am a first year PhD student in [statistics at the University of California Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/). My research interests involve using statistical machine learning methods to address applied problems. 

Previously, I double majored in [mathematics](https://math.ufl.edu/) and [statistics at the University of Florida](https://stat.ufl.edu/). My undergraduate [research projects](#projects) in statistics had applications in areas ranging from computer vision to classical music, as well as public health.  

Outside of statistics, my personal interests and hobbies include music, art, hiking, and spending time with my cats.
