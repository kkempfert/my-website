I am a fourth-year PhD student in [statistics at the University of California Berkeley](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/), where I am advised by Dr. Christopher Paciorek. Broadly, my research involves combining classical time series methods and machine learning approaches for improved prediction, generation, intepretation, and uncertainty quantification. Specifically, I am applying generative long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to rainfall time series. 

I am grateful to be supported by the Chancellor's Fellowship and National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship.

Previously, I double majored in [mathematics](https://math.ufl.edu/) and [statistics at the University of Florida](https://stat.ufl.edu/). My undergraduate [research projects](#projects) in statistics had applications in areas ranging from computer vision to classical music, as well as public health.  

Outside of statistics, my personal interests and hobbies include playing piano, creating art, enjoying the outdoors, and spending time with my cat.
